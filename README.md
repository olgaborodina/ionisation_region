# ionisation_region
An ionisation region simulation (during astrophysics lab, UrFU)

Here you can find three .ipynb files:

**1. HII_structure.ipynb** simple code modeling H-only ionisation region near star with planck spectrum.
**2. HII_structure_real_spectrum.ipynb** still simple code modeling H-only ionisation region near star. But its spectrum is taken from Kuruch (1979, ApJS). 
**3. HII_structure_dif_models.ipynb** nice code modeling realistic ionisation region near star. This region could contain helium, oxygen and even dust. Dust could be simulated in two ways: Draine (1993, ApJ) or MRN (Mathis, Rumpl, & Nordsieck 1977, ApJ).

Here is also .pdf file with slides in russian.
